# A CMS analysis with paper-ready plots

The goal of this example is to show how to use `fasthep-flow` to perform a full
HEP analysis with paper-ready plots and tables. This includes more complex tasks
such as:

- systematic uncertainties for MC samples and/or physics objects
- control regions for background estimation
- scale factors for data/MC comparison
- statistical analysis of the results
- provenance tracking for reproducibility and accountability

```{note}
Looking for volunteers and public data to create this example!
