# Operators

Operators are used here as a general term of callable code blocks that operate on data. In Airflow, operators are used to define tasks in a DAG. In `fasthep-flow`, operators are used to define stages in a workflow. The operators are defined in the YAML file, and then mapped to Airflow operators when the DAG is generated.
