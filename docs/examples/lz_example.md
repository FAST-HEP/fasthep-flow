# LUX-ZEPLIN Analysis tutorial

[LUX-ZEPLIN](https://lz.lbl.gov/) is a direct detection Dark Matter experiment
located at the Sanford Underground Research Facility
([SURF](https://sanfordlab.org/)) in Lead, South Dakota. It is a dual-phase
xenon time projection chamber, with a fiducial mass of 5.6 tonnes of liquid
xenon. The goal of the experiment is to detect the scattering of Weakly
Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) off xenon nuclei. The experiment is
currently under construction, and is expected to start taking data in 2020.
